# hunger-in-KC
This project examines hunger in Kansas City. How extensive is the problem? What trends can we see over time? What is the community doing about it? It's all part of an investigation for <a href="http://www.flatlandkc.org/" target="_blank">Flatland</a>, KCPT's digital magazine. 

Data I'm using:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.feedingamerica.org/research/map-the-meal-gap/by-county.html" target="_blank">Feeding America's reports</a> on child food insecurity by county. These are available as PDFs, so we'll have to scrape them.</li>
  <li>Enrollment in free/reduced lunch programs, available for both <a href="https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/1964-students-enrolled-in-free-reduced-price-lunch?loc=27&loct=2#detailed/5/4149-4263/false/870,573,869,36,868,867,133,38,35,18/any/4132,17339" target="_blank">Missouri</a> and <a href="https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/1277-free-and-reduced-lunch?loc=18&loct=2#detailed/2/any/false/871,870,573,869,36,868,867,133,38,35/any/2761" target="_blank">Kansas</a> through KIDS COUNT.</li>
</ul>

This is my first project using Python. Stay tuned!
